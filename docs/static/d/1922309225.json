Each of these panels has different purpose and these will be described throughout this section.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Section 1: The Console\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Console.jpg\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\nNotes: This is where commands and text output will appear when they are run. Commands can be typed directly into the console after the prompt symbol `>`. To run a command, hit Enter after typing it. Commands can also be run from a script (This is recommended).\r\n\r\nIf your console is showing a `+` on the left hand side then this is likely due to a parenthesis that has not been closed - if you are not sure where to close the parenthesis you can press Esc to return to the prompt symbol.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Section 2: The Environment\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Environment.jpg\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\nNotes: The environment panel has multiple tabs, but we'll focus on the Environment tab and the history tab.\r\n\r\n*Environment*\r\n\r\nEach time you create a new object in R it will appear in the environment. This is where you will find a list of all variables or object that are available to call by name. This is very useful for checking the types of objects that have already been created and find out what their names are.\r\n\r\n*History*\r\n\r\nThe history is similar to the environment, but it stores r commands which have been run during a session. You can search through these for a previously run command using the search bar at the top right of the panel.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Section 3: Files\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Files.jpg\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\nNotes: This panel has multiple tabs. We will focus on the Files, Plots, Packages and Help tabs. The Viewer tab is used for more advanced features\r\n\r\n*Files*\r\n\r\nThis tab acts as a file browser. You can navigate your way through the files on your computer. You can also use this to set your **working directory** (more on that later!)\r\n\r\n*Plots*\r\n\r\nWhen you run a command to create a plot it will show up under the Plots tab. If you have created several plots, then there are arrows which will allow you to cycle through your plots. You can then export the current plot for use in reports.\r\n\r\n*Packages*\r\n\r\nR packages contain sets of functions, which usually link together to perform some specific analysis. You can see which packages you have installed and load packages from this tab.\r\n\r\nYou are likely to need to use a package that is not available as part of the default installation of R. To use this type of package you will first have to install it. There are two ways to do this:\r\n\r\nrun the command `install.packages(\"package_name\")`\r\nor using the mouse navigate to **Tools > Install Packagesâ€¦** and type the name of the package into the dialogue box\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of packages that are installed with R, but to reduce the time it takes to open R, the packages that are loaded by default is limited. To load a package run the command `library(package_name)`. Note that the package name does not need to be in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n*Help*\r\n\r\nThis is where any help files/R Documentation will appear. To obtain the help file for a particular R function type `?function` into the console, where function can be replaced with the name of any R function that you require help with.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Time to summarise","fields":{"slug":"/chapter1_02_Interface"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nNotes: This section will walk you through how to install R and RStudio both on Windows machines and on Macs. Note that you will need to download and install both pieces of software! R is the underlying programming language that is being used, when I'm talking about installing R, I mean installing the software that can turn the programming language into some useful output. You don't need RStudio to run R code, however it does make things easier! RStudio is essentially a user interface, which makes programming in R a bit easier.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Step 1: Installing R\r\n\r\nAll installations of R can be found on the [**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).\r\n\r\nOnce there, you chould locate the section called *Download and Install R*:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"CRAN.jpg\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\nNotes: The first step is to install R. Without R, RStudio is useless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Step 1: Installing R\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\n1. click on the link that says *Download R for Windows*. You will be taken to the following page:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"rforwindows.jpg\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2. click on the link base (highlighted above).\r\n\r\n3. click the link which reads *Download R x.x.x for Windows* (x.x.x denotes the version number, which may vary depending on when you are downloading). \r\n\r\n4. open the .exe file and follow the instructions\r\n\r\n5. when asked to select a \"mirror\" select one which is in your country\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: When asked to select a mirror, you should try to pick one which is reasonably close geographically. For example, in the UK there are two servers: University of Bristol and Imperial College London. I am based in Glasgow so I would usually use the University of Bristol.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Step 1: Installing R\r\n\r\n## Mac\r\n\r\n1. click *Download R for (Mac) OS X* \r\n\r\n2. open the .pkg file that is downloaded and follow the installation instructions. \r\n\r\n3. when asked to select a \"mirror\" select one which is in your country\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: When asked to select a mirror, you should try to pick one which is reasonably close geographically. For example, in the UK there are two servers: University of Bristol and Imperial College London. I am based in Glasgow so I would usually use the University of Bristol.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Installing RStudio\r\n\r\nRStudio can be downloaded from [rstudio.com](rstudio.com). \r\n\r\n1. click on the *Download* link which is at the top right of the page\r\n\r\n2 click the download button underneath RStudio Desktop:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"downloadrstudio.jpg\" width=\"60%\">\r\n\r\n3. your system type will be automatically detected and you can just click the blue button to download the relevant installer \r\n\r\n4. open the installer and follow the instructions - the installer will automatically link R with RStudio.\r\n\r\nNotes: If at step 3, your operating system hasn't been correctly detected, other installers are available in a table below. Click on the link to download the appropriate installer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Run RStudio for the first time\r\n\r\nNotes: Once you have completed the steps above, you will be able to open and run RStudio. We'll look at the interface in the next section\r\n\r\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter1_01_SetUp"}}}]}}}
